# Project summary
This is a simple random password generator. On page load, it asks the user a series of questions about the desired password - length, special characters, number, uppercase, and lowercase. Once all of the questions have been answered, the user can press the "Generate Password" button and a password meeting the selected criteria will be returned. The input is validated in two ways: 
1. if the requested password is longer than 128 or shorter than 8 characters, the user is reminded about the password length;
2. if the user selects no type of characters, the user is reminded to select a character. 

Future versions of this generator should use better means to enforce the data validation (beyond the simple reminders) as the user can still select passwords that are too long or too short.

Project instructions are below:


# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at [some examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
